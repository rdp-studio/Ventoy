GitHub

This is now the main development repository for Squashfs-Tools.

There are older repositories on Sourceforge and kernel.org.  These
are currently out of date, but should be updated in the near future.

The kernel directories are obsolete, all kernel code is now in
mainline at www.kernel.org.

kernel-2.4: If you still need Squashfs support in the 2.4 kernel
then use the squashfs 3.2-r2 release.  This is the last release
that has a Mksquashfs which generates filesystems mountable with
Squashfs patched 2.4 kernels.  This release has patches for 2.4
kernels (but they have not been updated since the 3.1 release).
